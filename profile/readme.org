BISOS is part of ByStar /By*/
.
The *Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem* (/By* DE/) is an interdisciplinary, and
ethics-oriented non-proprietary digital ecosystem which challenges the existing
proprietary American digital ecosystem while operating concurrently alongside
it. On a global scale, By* provide Internet Application Services which preserve
autonomy and privacy of the individual. *BISOS*: (/By* Internet Services Operating
System/) is a unified and universal framework for developing both internet
services and software-service continuums that use internet services. BISOS is a
layer on top of Debian. *Blee*: (/BISOS Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment/) is a layer
on top of Emacs and BISOS, which creates a comprehensive integrated usage and
development environment. Blee and BISOS are fully integrated. See the "*Nature of
Polyexistentials*" book for the bigger picture of how all of ByStar fits together.

For bootstraping BISOS, Blee and ByStar; you can start at: https://github.com/bxgenesis/start

Here we provide some pointers to related BISOS github organizations and various
BISOS git Repos and introduce the basic concepts of BISOS.

* Overview of BISOS and ByStar Digital Ecosystem

BISOS (ByStar Internet Services OS) is a reification of the abstraction
of "A Universal Internet Services OS". ByStar is a concrete form of the
abstraction of "A Unified Autonomous Digital Ecosystem".

BISOS has the following key characteristics.

1.  BISOS is both purposeful and general purpose. BISOS is ideology
    driven. The general purpose of BISOS is to facilitate the creation
    of digital ecosystems that prioritize autonomy and privacy. The
    specific purpose of BISOS is to facilitate creation of the
    Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem.

2.  BISOS is layered on top of the Universal Debian software.

3.  BISOS facilitates secure and private possession and portability of
    the user's information through the abstraction of ByStar Portable
    Objects (BPO).

4.  BISOS enables the two-way transfer of Libre Services from the user's
    own possession to Libre Service providers and between Libre Service
    providers through the Possession Assertable Libre Services (PALS)
    abstraction.

5.  BISOS creates software-service continuums through universality on
    both server-side and usage-side.

6.  BISOS services integration and usage integration structures are
    self-confined to select languages: Python, Bash, Elisp and C/C++.
    Each language environment is augmented with BISOS native frameworks.
    The primary integration framework of BISOS is
    Python-Command-Services (PyCS).

7.  The primary usage interface for BISOS is Blee (ByStar Libre-Halaal
    Emacs Environment), which is comprehensive and extends to
    development environments.

8.  BISOS server-side PALS features are based on specific profiles from
    Debian packages collection. The profiles primary focus on autonomous
    email and autonomous content publication.

9.  BISOS usage-side capabilities are based on specific profiles from
    Debian packages collection. The profiles primary focus on email
    handling and content production.

10. BISOS platforms are automated to be recreatable from BPO contained
    information as physical and virtual images. Linux KVM is the only
    supported virtualization model.

11. BISOS's basic unit is a site. A BISOS-Site includes a private git
    server and a registrar.

BISOS facilities are used to create the infrastructure of ByStar and
various types of ByStar services.

[[/lcnt/lgpc/bystar/permanent/common/figures/bystarPortableCapabilities.pdf]]

Figure [[#fig:bystarPortableCapabilities][[fig:bystarPortableCapabilities]]]
depicts layerings of BISOS and of ByStar services. The Universal Debian
Gnu/Linux is our foundation on top of which BISOS resides.

The box labeled "Services SW" refers to instances of BISOS service-side
debian packages. The box labeled "Facilities SW" refers to instances of
BISOS usage-side debian packages. Configuration information for packages
reside in BPOs (By* Portable Objects).

The combination of "Services SW" and its relevant configuration within a
BPO, forms a "Portable Services Capability". The combination of
"Facilities SW" and its relevant configuration within a BPO, forms a
"Portable Facilities Capability".

Possession Assertable Libre Service is a type of
=Portable Services Capability=. Multi-Account Resident Mail Exchange
Environment (MARMEE) is a type of =Portable Facility Capability=.

Possession Assertable Autonomous Identities (PAAI) are types of BPOs
which include the identifiers (e.g., domain names) that enable PALS to
become Realized Services.

The stack on the right side of
Figure [[#fig:bystarPortableCapabilities][[fig:bystarPortableCapabilities]]]
depicts BISOS's usage environment which we describe in
Section [[#sec:ByStarLibre-HalaalEmacsuserEnvironment(Blee)][[sec:ByStarLibre-HalaalEmacsuserEnvironment(Blee)]]].

The stack on the left side of
Figure [[#fig:bystarPortableCapabilities][[fig:bystarPortableCapabilities]]]
depicts evolution of platforms in BISOS. A BISOS-Platform is a Debian
computer loaded with BISOS software. A BPO-Container is a BISOS-Platform
which has received (contains) some BPOs. A PAAI-Container is a
BPO-Container which ontains one or more PAAI-BPO.

** BISOS: an Over Debian Pure Blend
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-an-over-debian-pure-blend
   :END:

Debian defines Pure Blend as: "a subset of Debian that is configured to
support a particular target group out-of-the-box. One way to understand
this is a list of packages that gets installed to provide a focus of
use."

The lower layers of BISOS can be considered a Debian Pure Blend.
BISOS-service-side has one deb-pkgs-profile and BISOS-usage-side has
another deb-pkgs-profile.

But BISOS goes beyond that. BISOS and Debian are not peers. BISOS is a
layer on top of Debian. BISOS provides services-oriented facilities that
go beyond the scope of Debian. BISOS has its own policies and practices
that are a super set of Debian policies and practices. While the basic
unit of Debian is a computer, the basic unit of BISOS is a BISOS-Site.

** BISOS's Basic Unit: BISOS-Site
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bisoss-basic-unit-bisos-site
   :END:

Typically, the basic unit of an Operating System is one computer ---
depending on the context the computer is called: a host, a system, a
platform, a box, etc.

With BISOS the basic unit is more than one computer. We call BISOS's
basic unit: BISOS-Site. Fundamental BISOS abstractions are based on
BISOS Portable Objects (BPO) which are implemented as git accounts. Some
BPOs must be private. So, a BISOS-Site must include a private git server
--- which is implemented as a Gitlab instance. BISOS's use of BPO is
purely through a Python API interface. Gitlab GUI is hardly ever used.
BISOS also relies on the uniqueness of names and numbers. BISOS
therefore needs an automated registrar for some private names and
numbers. For BISOS to fully operate, at a minimum it needs those
services.

A BISOS-Site also provides facilities for creation and management of
Virtual Machines (VMs) and a simple BISOS-CMDB (configuration management
database) --- a central repository for storing BISOS-Site related
resource. For creation and recreation of VMs (image management), BISOS
uses Vagrant.

** BISOS Portable Objects (BPO)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-portable-objects-bpo
   :END:

 [sec:BISOSPortableObjects(BPO)]

A fundamental abstraction of BISOS is the concept of BISOS Portable
Objects (BPO). BPOs are packages of information. There are some
similarities between BPOs as packages of information and software
packages such as deb-packages or rpm-packages.

Like software packages, BPOs are named uniquely and can depend on each
other and can be collectively installed and uninstalled. BPOs are used
for many things similar to how the files system is used for many things.
BPOs can be used to hold the complete configuration information of a
system. BPOs can be used to hold configuration information for software
packages. BPOs can be used to hold private user data. BPOs can be used
to hold collections of content and source code.

For its own operation, BISOS uses various BPO types. Other types of BPOs
can be created or generic BPO types (for example the Project type) can
be used.

Each BPO consists of a number of Git Repositories (hereafter called
"repos"). Each of the BPO's repos can be synchronized using generic Git
tools. With Blee/Emacs we use MaGit exclusively.

Scope of access and use of BPOs can be private, group, public or system
oriented.

BPOs can be private, residing entirely in the Inner Rims, and used for
private exclusive use of their owners. Private BPOs are used by their
owners for a variety of purposes. For example, one's address book
(rolodex) can be captured in a private BPO. This allows for
synchronization of the address book as a git based portable object
across different devices and across different environments.

BPOs can be used to facilitate collaboration among groups of autonomous
users. Group BPOs are only accessible to you, and people you explicitly
share access with. Group BPOs are functionally similar to GitHub private
repositories --- but in a decentralized fashion instead of GitHub's
central model.

Public BPOs facilitate publication of content and public evolution of
that content through git. Public BPOs are functionally similar to GitHub
public repositories --- but in a decentralized fashion instead of
GitHub's central model.

System BPOs are BISOS specific information that contain system related
information. System BPOs can be "materialized" and function as Virtual
Machines and Services and PALS (Possession Assertable Libre Services).
System BPOs can be used to capture System configurations and SBOMs
(Software Bill Of Material). System BPOs can be private or public.

BPOs are currently implemented as Gitlab accounts. Gitlab accounts are
Unix non-login shell accounts. BISOS's interactions with Gitlab is
exclusively through an API (Remote Operations). Each Gitlab account then
can contain repos subject to common access control mechanisms. Gitlab
accounts map to BPO-Identifiers (BPO-Id). Each BPO-id then maps to Unix
non-login shell accounts. The Unix account then becomes the base for
cloning of the repos in the corresponding Gitlab account.

BPOs go through different states and stages. A "Registered" BPO reserves
a particular name/number for that BPO. "Realization" of a BPO results in
creation of the git account that holds the repositories of that BPO and
its subsequent activation. "Activation" of the BPO results in creation
of a non-login account on the system and cloning of the repositories of
that BPO. Activated BPOs can then be kept in sync through Git. An
activated System BPO can then be "Materialized". Materialization of a
System BPO results in creation of BISOS entities.

Combinations of profiled deb-packages for internet application services
and their configurations in the form of BPOs can then create Libre
Services that are possession assertable, portable and transferable.

** BISOS Possession Assertable Libre Services (PALS)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-possession-assertable-libre-services-pals
   :END:

 [sec:BISOSPossessionAssertableLibreServices(PALS)]

Based on capabilities of BPOs and the capabilities of service-side
profiled Debian packages, we can now create Libre Services.

BISOS Libre Services can be thought of four parts:

1. Libre-Halaal software of the services (usually a Debian Package)

2. Configuration information for the software for the service (often as
   a repo of a PALS-BPO)

3. Names and numbers for binding of services (as a repo of a PAAI-BPO)

4. Service owner data (in the form of one or more BPOs)

This model provides for portability and transferability of Libre
Services between network abodes. For example, a Libre Service at a
provider can be transferred to its owner to be self-hosted.

There are some similarities between PALS-BPO and container
virtualization (Docker and Kubernetes). PALS-BPOs include comprehensive
information for construction of services and these can be mapped to
container virtualization. However, at this time BISOS does not use
container virtualization, as it is redundant. BISOS uses BPOs to create
and recreate Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVM) inside of which
PALS-BPOs are deployed.

Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a Libre Service
under one's own full control at one's own premise. BISOS Possession
Assertable Libre Services (PALS) can be initially self-hosted and then
transferred to a Libre Service provider. PALS can also be initially
externally hosted and then become self-hosted on demand. The concept of
"transferability" between network abodes is well supported in BISOS.

*** Network Abodes and Transferability
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: network-abodes-and-transferability
    :END:

 [sec:NetworkAbodesandTransferability]

In the proprietary American digital ecosystem, the concept of network
abodes is mostly vague. Names such as cloud and edge are used without
much precision, and, the concept of transferability simply does not
exist. You cannot self-host your Gmail service.

Within ByStar and BISOS, we have precise definitions for where Libre
Services can be realized and where they can be transferred to. This is
depicted in Figure [[#fig:networkAbodes][[fig:networkAbodes]]]

[[/lcnt/lgpc/bystar/permanent/common/figures/networkAbodes.pdf]]

Let's define "edge" as point of demarcation between the public digital
world and the physical world (and its associated private digital
environment). In Figure [[#fig:networkAbodes][[fig:networkAbodes]]] this
is depicted as a dotted red circle. When by physical world, we mean
"things", then in the American Internet, we have the culture and lingo
of IoT (Internet of Things) Edge Computing. But what if by the physical
world, we mean people --- individuals?

The three concentric circles on the outer side of the edge are called
"Rims". These are:

1. Exposed Rim.

   Systems in the Exposed Rim are on your premise, and they are
   externally visible. Wifi hotspots, routers and VPNs are usually in
   the Exposed Rim. Self-Hosting of PALS occurs in the Exposed Rim. We
   refer to the abode of the collection of Self-Hosted PALS as the
   Public Rim. Systems in the Exposed Rim should be well secured as they
   are vulnerable to direct attacks.

2. Inner Rim.

   Systems in the Inner Rim are on your premise behind a firewall.
   private desktops, fileservers, private Gitlab and private registrars
   are usually in the Inner Rim. Systems in the Inner Rim are usually
   physically stationary.

   The likes of security systems, media centers, and monitoring cameras
   that in the proprietary model are considered
   customer-premise-equipment (CPE) are regarded as yours in the ByStar
   model. Such services of yours reside in your Inner Rim.

3. Outer Rim.

   Systems in the Outer Rim are usually portable devices and at this
   time they are on your premise behind a firewall. Laptops, Pads,
   Mobile-Phones (with wifi access) are usually in the Outer Rim.
   Systems in the Outer Rim are usually portable devices.

The four concentric circles on the outer side of the edge are called
"Rings". These are:

1. Collocation Ring.

   Systems in the Collocation Ring are on somebody else's premise
   (usually a data center), but they belong to you (or are rented by
   you). A collocation data center is a physical facility that offers
   space with the proper power, cooling, network connectivity and
   security to host other people's computing hardware and servers. There
   is a certain aspect of self-possession in the Collocation Ring.

2. Private Cloud Ring.

   Systems in the Private Cloud Ring are usually virtualized and are
   under your exclusive access.

3. Public Cloud Ring.

   Systems in the Public Cloud Ring are usually virtualized and are
   under your access.

4. Public Internet Application Services.

   Examples of Public Internet Application Services in the proprietary
   American digital ecosystem are Gmail, Facebook and Instagram. You pay
   for public proprietary internet application services by becoming the
   product, through your privacy.

In the model of the proprietary American digital ecosystem, a given
internet application service typically permanently resides in the ring
abodes and is not transferable to other service providers. The service
belongs to the service provider and it is locked.

In the ByStar model, the service belongs to its user and it is the user
who decides where she wants to realize it. This transferability is
accomplished through the abstractions of BPOs (BISOS Portable Objects),
PALS (Possession Assertable Libre Services) and PAAI (Possession
Assertable Autonomous Identities). In
Figure [[#fig:networkAbodes][[fig:networkAbodes]]] the segment labeled
"PAAI & PALS" spans the Exposed Rim, the Collocation Ring, the Private
Cloud Ring, the Public Cloud Ring and the Application Services Ring.
This means that a BISOS based Libre Services can be transferred between
any of those network abodes.

BISOS can also be used to provide access to proprietary internet
application services. This is shown in the segment labeled "AAS" of
Figure [[#fig:networkAbodes][[fig:networkAbodes]]]. Abstracted
Application Services (AAS) are facilities that allow for abstraction of
some proprietary internet application services to be used by BISOS. One
such internet service is Gmail. Gmail can be used through Blee-Gnus and
BISOS-MARMEE.

*** Ramifications of Libre-Halaal Edge-Oriented Strategies
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ramifications-of-libre-halaal-edge-oriented-strategies
    :END:

 [sec:RamificationsofLibre-HalaalEdge-OrientedStrategies]

To illustrate the privacy and autonomy-oriented benefits of the PALS
model, let's compare and contrast the American Internet with ByStar in
the context of a very simple but very important human application:
"email". To be more concrete and specific, in the context of the
American Internet, let's use the fictional example of an American
politician called "Hillary Clinton". In the context of ByStar, let's use
the fictional example of an Iranian engineer called "Mohsen Banan".

In the American Internet environment, the individual typically has at
least two email addresses. One is through her work, say at the State
Department, as: "hillary.clinton@state.gov". The other is for personal
use, as:\\
"hillary.clinton@gmail.com". Paying attention to her email addresses, we
note that "hillary.clinton" is always on the left side of the "@". This
means that "gmail.com" has risen in the middle and controls
"hillary.clinton@" --- and millions of others. This means that Google
has full possession and full control over Hillary's personal emails. Her
"hillary.clinton@gmail.com" emails are neither autonomous nor private.
Now, since Hillary Clinton is an intelligent and powerful American
politician, she has recognized that her privacy and autonomy are
important and that her email communications should be under her full
control. She is rich, so, she goes ahead and sets up her own email
server in her basement. We don't know if that email server was based on
proprietary software or not, but we do know that as an individualistic
American, she was only focused on addressing her own email autonomy and
privacy concerns. Email autonomy and privacy of society at large was not
her concern.

In the ByStar environment, the individual similarly also has two sets of
email addresses. Mohsen's work email may well be under the control of
his employer, but his private email service and email addresses are
under his own control. For personal use, Mohsen has registered and
obtained\\
=mohsen.banan.byname.net= for himself.\\
Notice that while =byname.net= is part of ByStar,\\
=mohsen.banan.byname.net= belongs to Mohsen. Based on that, he can now
create a series of email addresses for himself.\\
For example, he can use "bystarPlan@mohsen.banan.byname.net" for matters
related to distribution of this document.\\
He can use "card@mohsen.banan.byname.net" on his visit cards.

Now, let's compare and contrast the email addresses
"hillary.clinton@gmail.com" and\\
"myDesk@mohsen.banan.byname.net". The right-part of the '@' signifies
ownership and control. The right part of '@' controls the left-part of
'@'. So, =gmail.com= controls "hillary.clinton".\\
While =mohsen.banan.byname.net= controls "myDesk" and Mohsen, owns\\
=mohsen.banan.byname.net=. Notice that =gmail.com= controls millions of
people through their left-part. In ByStar, millions of people can obtain
their own right-parts and then control their own left-parts --- and own
their own portable full email addresses.\\
Notice that while =gmail.com= has positioned itself in the middle of the
network,\\
=mohsen.banan.byname.net= has positioned itself in the edge of the
network. Longer domain names which fully take advantage of DNS's
hierarchical design are manifestations of edge-oriented strategies.

Next, let's compare and contrast the software of the =gmail.com= service
against the software of\\
=mohsen.banan.byname.net=. The software of =gmail.com= service is
proprietary. It belongs to Google. We don't know what it does. When you
hit the delete button for a particular email, you can no longer see that
message. But perhaps Google is keeping all of your deleted messages
somewhere, forever. Because it is all proprietary software, you just
don't know what is actually happening with the emails that you may think
are yours. The software of =mohsen.banan.byname.net= services is part of
the public ByStar software. It is part of BISOS. It is a public
resource. That entire software is internally transparent. On your
behalf, the engineering profession knows what it does and what it does
not. When you delete one of your own email messages, it can be known
that it was truly deleted --- forever. This is what having a
Libre-Halaal Service means.

With ByStar in place, all the Hillary Clintons of this world can have
their own email communications under their own full control. We invite
Hillary Clinton to join ByStar. As an American politician, perhaps she
can start thinking about solving her society's email problems --- not
just her own. We welcome her assistance in promoting ByStar.

Consider the privacy and autonomy of such edge-to-edge email
communications between\\
"myDesk@mohsen.banan.byname.net" and\\
"myDesk@hillary.clinton.byname.net".\\
The mail protocol traffic is of course end-to-end encrypted between\\
=mohsen.banan.byname.net= and =hillary.clinton.byname.net=. The message
itself can additionally be encrypted. At no point is any third party in
possession of the clear-text message. Logs of the message transfer are
only in the possession of the two edges. And all of this can be realized
on an internet-scale.

All ByStar individual services are designed to be end-to-end and
edge-oriented. The concepts of end-to-end and edge-orientation are
integral to ByStar's decentralized design, which stands in stark
contrast to Gmail's highly centralized approach. However, these
edge-oriented services don't need to reside on the "Rims" side of the
network edge. Since ByStar individual services are possession-assertable
and portable, they can also be provisioned in the "Rings". See
Figure [[#fig:networkAbodes][[fig:networkAbodes]]] for the references to
Edge, Rims and Rings. This provides for options of self-hosting or
external-hosting of individual services. So, =byname.net= can be made to
be as convenient as =gmail.com= yet preserves the guarantees of autonomy
and privacy through being possession-assertable, portable, Libre-Halaal,
and edge-oriented.

While here we focused on the email service as an end-to-end
edge-oriented strategy, similar approaches can be applied to other
internet applications and intra-edge applications. In the edge-oriented
ByStar model, when you control the thermostat in your own house, that
can all happen as a ByStar intra-edge application without loss of
privacy and autonomy.

** BISOS Model of Platform Universality and Software-Service Continuums
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-model-of-platform-universalityand-software-service-continuums
   :END:

 [sec:BISOSModelofPlatformUniversality]

Earlier we made several points about the universality of BISOS. We
pointed out that BISOS inherits Debian's universality, and that our
design philosophy includes relying on a singular Unix with full
cohesion.

We have Service-Side BISOS for creation of internet services and we have
Usage-Side BISOS for usage of internet services. These two create the
BISOS software-service continuum. This is very powerful because the two
sides are very consistent. This is depicted in
Figure [[#fig:bxp-layerings][[fig:bxp-layerings]]].

[[/lcnt/lgpc/bystar/permanent/common/figures/bxp-layerings.pdf]]

Note in Figure [[#fig:bxp-layerings][[fig:bxp-layerings]]] that although
the lowest layer (hardware) of the two stacks is very different, most of
the rest of the stack is very common. Also note that on the top parts,
capabilities are complimentary based on the common lower layers.

The degree of consistency and cohesion that this universality creates if
far superior to what exists today in the proprietary American digital
ecosystem.

*** BISOS Virtualization Platform
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-virtualization-platform
    :END:

 [sec:BISOSVirtualizationPlatform]

The left side of Figure [[#fig:bxp-layerings][[fig:bxp-layerings]]]
depicts the Service Environment of BISOS. As shown, the BISOS Service
Environment is based on Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

BISOS Virtualization Platform uses KVM, virsh, and Vagrant to create the
needed foundation so that System BPOs representing BISOS KVMs can be
"Materialized" and "Re-Materialized". This permits us to transport VMs
across hosts and also to view VMs and their services as reproducible on
demand. This is the equivalent of viewing BISOS KVMs as disposable.

With BISOS, we have chosen not to use the likes of Openstack. Even a
minimal Openstack involves a fair amount resources and complexities
which are oriented towards medium size data-centers. You can think of
BISOS Virtualization Platform as a lightweight Openstack oriented
towards autonomous edges. BISOS Virtualization Platform privide a good
alternative to the likes of Openstack for small servers and
data-centers.

With BISOS, for PALS, we have chosen not to use the likes of
Docker-containers, Kubernetes and OpenShift. The concept of Service BPOs
allows us to abstract out service packages. The ByStar autonomous edge
oriented model does not demand the types of scalability and elasticity
that the likes of Kubernetes and OpenShift bring to the table. For
Central ByStar Services, where we will use the likes of Kubernetes and
OpenShift.

** BISOS Software-Service Continuum Apps
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-software-service-continuum-apps
   :END:

Thus far, we have provided an overview of the BISOS infrastructure.
Based on these, there are various capabilities that the owner-user can
profit from. In BISOS, we call these capabilities "Software-Service
Continuum Applications" (SSCA).

As described in
Section [[#sec:BISOSModelofPlatformUniversality][[sec:BISOSModelofPlatformUniversality]]]
--- and shown in Figure [[#fig:bxp-layerings][[fig:bxp-layerings]]],
part of the capability is realized in software on the user side and part
of the capability may realized on the services side. Since both the
user-side and the service-side are based on the universal BISOS platform
the resulting combined capability is consistent and flexible.

There are many BISOS software-service continuum applications and the
model is open ended. There is an SSCA for genealogy, for photo
galleries, and much more.

In BISOS, Software-Service Continuum Applications have a common
structure. They typically consist of a three layered stack.

1. BISOS-Svc-Layer: BISOS Services Layer runs as a service-provider and
   interacts with the BISOS-Sw-Layer.

2. BISOS-Sw-Layer: BISOS Software Layer that facilitates work of
   Blee-SSCA-Agent and interacts with BISOS-Svc-Layer.

3. Blee-SSCA-Agent: Emacs-Lisp Code of Blee which the user interacts
   with.

The general model of interactions between BISOS-Sw-Layer and
BISOS-Svc-Layer is typically that of Remote Operations where
BISOS-Sw-Layer assumes the invoker role and BISOS-Svc-Layer assumes the
performer role.

There are two BISOS software-service continuum applications that are
foundational. These are email processing and content generation and
self-publication.

*** BISOS Email Software-Service Continuum App
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-email-software-service-continuum-app
    :END:

Email is a foundational application. BISOS Email SSCA is structured as
follows: The Blee-SSCA-Agent for email is called Blee-Gnus. The
BISOS-Sw-Layer is called MARMEE (Multi-Account Resident Message Exchange
Environment). BISOS-Svc-Layer is called BISOS-Mail-Service.

[[/de/lcnt/lgpc/bystar/permanent/common/figures/marmeeBleeGnusIntegration.pdf]]

Figure [[#fig:marmeeBleeGnusIntegration][[fig:marmeeBleeGnusIntegration]]]
depicts Blee-Gnus and MARMEE in the context of split-MUA (Mail User
Agent) Blee-Gnus is the usage environment and MARMEE addresses mail
protocols processing. Gnus is a very flexible mail processing
environment which is integrated into Emacs.

BISOS uses a modified version of qmail called BISOS-qmail as the MTA
(Mail Transfer Agent). When used it as a traditional MTA, we refer to it
as PALS-qmail. And on the usage side we call it MARMEE-qmail. For
incoming mail within MARMEE, BISOS uses offlineimap.

It is possible to use MARMEE and Blee-Gnus to access other email
services. This is done through configuration of an AAS (Abstracted
Accessible Service). For example, in addition to ByStar email, an
owner-user can also access her gmail account with Blee-Gnus.

*** BISOS Content Generation and Self-Publication
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bisos-content-generation-and-self-publication
    :END:

 [sec:BISOSContentGenerationandSelf-Publication]

BISOS software-service continuum application for content generation and
self-publication is called LCNT (Libre Content).

The content generation capabilities of LCNT are akin to Microsoft-Word
and PowerPoint. But the model of content generation in BISOS is very
different from Microsoft-Word and Microsoft-PowerPoint. We use LaTeX for
document processing and COMEEGA-Blee for authorship.

[[./figures/bxMmDocProc.pdf]]

A pictorial overview of multi-media content generation is provided in
Figure [[#fig:bxMmDocProc][[fig:bxMmDocProc]]]. A single LaTeX source
file is used to embed text, images, audio and video. This single source
file is then processed in a variety of ways with a variety of tools
including XeLaTeX and HeVeA to produce a variety of outputs including
pdf and html. Multimedia frames/slides are then disposed using
reveal.js.

BISOS-LCNT also includes facilities for self-publication where the above
mentioned generated content can be pushed to owner-user's web sites and
can also be syndicated.

** Privacy and Regulatory Ramifications of BISOS
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: privacy-and-regulatory-ramifications-of-bisos
   :END:

Technological design of BISOS is very different from the technological
design of proprietary American internet application services.

BISOS capabilities revolve around the abstraction of the individual and
its belongings and delivery of possession and control of those
abstractions to the individual. In BISOS, you own and possess your own
data and you can own and possess your own services.

BISOS's philosophy is privacy by design.

Privacy by design is the antithesis of the proprietary American internet
application services model, which is based on surveillance by design.
Surveillance by design leads to centralized architectures and control,
while privacy by design architecture leads to distributed architectures
and autonomous control.

Since proprietary American internet application services are
fundamentally designed for surveillance, the needed societal regulations
are complex and ineffective. Since ByStar and BISOS are fundamentally
designed for privacy, societal regulations are very simple and
effective. ByStar is designed to be self-regulating. ByStar promotes
proactive regulations as opposed to the current model of reactive
regulations. The engineers have done the work. The politicians just need
to understand. The bulk of the needed regulations can amount to
exclusive use of PALS Libre Services as defined in
Section [[#sec:DefinitionOfPals][[sec:DefinitionOfPals]]] --- .

** ByStar and BISOS Security
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bystar-and-bisos-security
   :END:

The fundamental design of BISOS carries significant security
implications across various dimensions.

Due to its complete open-source nature, the ByStar software supply chain
is susceptible to the common vulnerabilities present in open-source
ecosystems. To address these vulnerabilities, we have implemented a
clear Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to identify ByStar software
components, ensuring their origin from trustworthy sources. We've
adopted a pinned model to prevent unexpected changes and will establish
mirrors for all used packages at bysource.org and bybinary.org, which
will become the sole sources for ByStar systems to obtain software
packages.

ByStar incorporates many leading security practices for authentication,
authorization, and access control. SSH keys are extensively utilized,
with passwords rarely employed. Continual scrutiny of BISOS's security
design is essential.

The combined capabilities of BPOs, PALS, and service recreation within
BISOS render many traditional security models obsolete. Furthermore,
autonomous Libre Services, being transferable and easily recreatable,
further challenge conventional security paradigms. In the event of
intrusion detection or periodically as a preventive measure,
contaminated services can be swiftly replaced with fresh instances, with
potential for full automation.

** ByStar and Edge Oriented Uses of BISOS
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bystar-and-edge-oriented-uses-of-bisos
   :END:

ByStar's primary offerings are real, tangible and practical autonomy and
privacy -- on a very large scale. The scope of ByStar is everything. The
"*" in By* comes from Unix's glob expansion symbol. All ByStar services
are unified and consistent. The integrated facilities of ByStar are
intended to be used by a very large segment of the population on this
planet.

In terms of richness of services, ByStar capabilities are vast ---
paralleling most of what exists in the proprietary internet today. But
there are two fundamental differences:

1. the ownership model of the service --- proprietary vs Libre-Halaal

2. the manner of deployment and usage of the services ---
   rise-of-the-middle vs edge-oriented

These in turn have immense ramifications on autonomy and privacy of the
individual. The technology used to deliver ByStar services is often
based on existing open-source software. ByStar does not limit or reduce
any of the positive aspects of the existing internet. By changing the
model, it alleviates the negative privacy and autonomy threats.

ByStar does not intend to displace the American internet immediately. It
is an evolutionary strategy. The Libre-Halaal ByStar digital ecosystem
exists in parallel with the proprietary American digital ecosystem, but
with separate values. Throughout this exposition, we compare and
contrast ByStar with "The American Internet." By that we mean, the
proprietary American digital ecosystem as it exists today as a set of
internet application services dominated by American corporations and the
American model. We fully endorse the global equal access model of the
internet at layer 3. It is the exclusive rise-of-the-middle American
model of internet at layer 7 that we reject.

The specific purpose of BISOS is to facilitate the creation of
Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem.

Let's see how ByStar uses BISOS to realize the underlying model and
capabilities of the Libre-Halaal ByStar digital ecosystem.

- ByStar is about redecentralization of the internet. Control and
  ownership is transferred from central corporations to distributed
  individuals (as autonomous entities). Rise-of-the-middle model is
  rejected in favor of the autonomous edges model.

  BISOS was designed for all of that. BISOS is inherently edge oriented.

- ByStar software and internet services are un-owned/publicly-owned and
  internally transparent.

  BISOS's Libre-Halaal software adheres to the AGPL license. All
  components of ByStar Individual Services can be replicated using their
  accessible source code.

- Broadly speaking, ByStar services fall into these 3 categories:

  1. ByStar Individual (Possession-Assertable/Autonomous) Services.

  2. ByStar Content Syndication Services.

  3. ByStar Facilitated Direct and Assisted Inter-Autonomous Interaction
     Services.

  BISOS PALS address (1) and (3). BISOS's Libre Content (LCNT) addresses
  (2).

- ByStar individual services represent real individuals in the real
  world. In ByStar, real individuals have real autonomy, real control
  and real ownership of their own ByStar individual services. ByStar
  individual services are edge-oriented and can be externally-hosted or
  self-hosted. When externally hosted, ByStar individual services are
  regulated to be portable and possession-assertable. For example,
  Mohsen's ByStar individual services is:\\
  =mohsen.1.banan.byname.net=.\\
  You can have your own as: =first.last.byname.net=. Since you own your
  domain and since you can fully possess the service and your data at
  will, you have real autonomy.

  BISOS PAAI is designed to support deep domain names and PALS are
  transferable.

- ByStar individual services are "Possession-Assertable". A portable
  hosted service can be transferred to the individual who owns it where
  the individual becomes her own Application Service Provider. For
  example, people can run their own fully private email servers in their
  own houses. Just like Hillary Clinton.

  Some early examples of ByStar possession-assertable individual service
  factory domains are: =ByName.net=, =ByFamily=, =BySMB=, =ByMemory=,
  =ByAlias=, =ByWhere=, =ByAuthor= and =ByArtist=.

- Direct inter-autonomous relations such as Facebook style photo sharing
  are accomplished through the individual's own possession-assertable
  authorization services (individualized OAuth services). Healthy
  equivalents of capabilities of typical social networks can be created
  with PALS authorization services where each individual uses his own
  OAuth service to grant access to his own resources.

  BISOS-OAuth supports this.

- Syndication services such as Youtube style content publication are
  clearly regulated and integrated with ByStar content production
  capabilities of individual services. Some early examples of ByStar
  syndication services are: =ByTopic=, =ByContent=, =ByLookup=,
  =ByEvent=, =BySource=, =ByBinary=, =BySearch=.

- Facilitated inter-autonomous interaction services such as dating,
  auction and trade services, are clearly regulated and well integrated
  with ByStar identity services. Some early examples of ByStar
  inter-autonomous facilitated interaction services are:\\
  =ByInteraction=, =ByHookUp=, =ByEntity=.

- ByStar also functions as a hierarchical registrar. For example, Mohsen
  Banan's registration of =mohsen.1.banan.byname.net= with the
  =byname.net= registrar results in ownership of
  =mohsen.1.banan.byname.net= by Mohsen Banan. This domain registration
  is independent of the service provider that is hosting the portable
  and possession-assertable individual service. The combination of the
  portable owned domain and the portability of publicly-owned ByStar
  individual services allows for transparent transfer of an individual
  service from one hosting service to another hosting service. This
  accomplishes the equivalent of Wireless Local Number Portability. Such
  fundamental user freedoms are absent in the American internet.

  BISOS PALS are portable and transferable.

- ByStar is mostly self-regulated. Upon assertion by the user-owner, the
  ByStar individual service provider must fully and permanently delete
  the possession-asserted service and all her data. Or otherwise, ab
  initio let the owner know that her data will be maintained. Within
  applicable jurisdictions, ByStar service providers must comply with
  Lawful Interception (LI) and satisfy regulatory requirements and legal
  obligations towards Law Enforcement Agencies. Syndication and
  facilitated inter-autonomous relation providers are subject to known
  and clear regulations and restrictions.

Much of what you find on GitHub today represents the surrogate activities of
tunnel vision technocrats (sec 12.1.7). These engineers often produce or improve
component-oriented FOSS results which are usually tactical and limited in scope
and often end up catering to the interests of corporate American proprietary
internet service providers. ByStar, however, follows a different model. ByStar's
Git repositories are structured as public GitHub organizations that align with the
architecture of ByStar itself. All of these components primarily contribute to
our own digital ecosystem. Key engineering components of ByStar include: ::\\
*BISOS:* /By* Internet Services Operating System/ ---
On top of Debian, BISOS builds a unified and universal framework for developing
both internet services and software-service continuums that use internet
services. :: \\
*Blee: BISOS Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment* --- On top of Emacs and BISOS, Blee creates a
comprehensive integrated usage and development environment. Blee and BISOS are
fully integrated. ::\\
*BPO: BISOS Portable Objects* --- With
Git and similar to Apt, BPO establishes a platform for packaging of data,
software, and configurations of software. This creates a uniform model for
portability, encompassing services and personal information. ::
*PALS: Possession Assertable Libre Services* --- With
BPO and BISOS, PALS construct a model for optional self hosting of services.
In ByStar, individual-oriented services belong to the individual
and through PALS, autonomy and privacy is enforceable. ::
